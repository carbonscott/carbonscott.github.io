<h1 class="title">A conversation with a U of Chicago postdoc</h1>

<p>Should I become a postdoc? Here’s what I learned following a conversation with a postdoc working at the University of Chicago. He graduated with a doctoral degree in chemistry in Oct 2019.</p>
<h3 id="when-did-you-start-to-look-for-post-doctoral-positions-how-did-it-go">When did you start to look for post-doctoral positions? How did it go?</h3>
<p>I sent out my first email asking for postdoc opportunities in Dec 2018. But I was busy with my research and publication immediately from the beginning of 2019. I seriously started my postdoc finding in June, when I emailed about 10-15 professors in my field. One of them invited me for an on-site interview in Augst 2019. In the same month, I met my current advisor at a symposium in our own Chemistry department at the University of Illinois at Chicago. We had an interview shortly after the symposium. That’s how I get here.</p>

### How different is your post-doctoral lifestyle compared with your PhD's?

It depends on the working culture.  I was under a lot pressure working with my
PhD advisor.  However, my current PI is not very demanding.

<h3 id="do-you-keep-learning-new-skillstechniques-or-you-keep-applying-phd-skills-to-your-current-work">Do you keep learning new skills/techniques or you keep applying PhD skills to your current work?</h3>
<p>I think it’s half-half. I continue doing benchwork and collecting X-ray diffraction data myself. Meanwhile, I learned a lot about DNA binding protein during the lockdown (due to COVID19) and would learn Cryo-EM later. In fact, I decided to be a postdoc because I want to learn more about Cryo-EM.</p>
<h3 id="as-a-postdoc-what-are-the-things-you-likedislike">As a postdoc, what are the things you like/dislike?</h3>
<p>I like the fact that I can work towards my goal here at the University of Chicago at my own pace. But my PI is frugal on purchasing lab equipments sometimes so that I need to learn how to figure out a workaround.</p>
<h3 id="have-you-considered-going-to-industry-whats-your-next-career-move">Have you considered going to industry? What’s your next career move?</h3>
<p>My next move is the industry. I have seen people from my current lab got into industry.</p>
<h3 id="what-other-people-do-you-recommend-me-to-talk-with">What other people do you recommend me to talk with?</h3>
<p>Maybe a machine learning scientist from Argonne national lab. He plays tennis, maybe you should come. (lol)</p>
