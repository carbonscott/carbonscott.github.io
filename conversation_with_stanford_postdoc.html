<p>Should I become a postdoc? Here’s what I learned following a conversation with a postdoc working at the Stanford University. He graduated with a doctoral degree in chemistry in May 2018.</p>
<h3 id="when-did-you-start-to-look-for-post-doctoral-positions-how-did-it-go">When did you start to look for post-doctoral positions? How did it go?</h3>
<p>I started looking for postdoc positions in Oct 2017. I did my own research and selected 30-40 top research groups in the field of my interest. Then, I discussed with my PhD supervisor regarding the selections I made. My supervisor gave me invaluable suggestions on their research and their working culture. I eventually decided to go to my current lab.</p>
<h3 id="do-you-keep-learning-new-skillstechniques-or-you-keep-applying-phd-skills-to-your-current-work">Do you keep learning new skills/techniques or you keep applying PhD skills to your current work?</h3>
<p>I keep learning new skills. My PhD background is fundamental electrochemistry. My current research is more interdisciplinary including working with biologists. I think both senarios exist in a research lab. Some postdocs dive deeper in the field that they worked on during their PhD time. But some try out a new branch of research. In fact, a benefit of trying new things is that it enables people work across different disciplines. So you will collaborate with people and it enlarges the impact of your research.</p>
<h3 id="as-a-post-doc-what-are-the-things-you-likedislike">As a post-doc, what are the things you like/dislike?</h3>
<p>Interesting! I think the thing I like and dislike is the same – collaboration in an interdisciplinary environment. On one hand, you are making impact on a larger scale. On the other hand, the duration of a project is substantailly longer than my past field – electrochemistry. The pandemic exacerbated my research progress. I had to change my plan after the lab was reopen in June.<br />
It’s a big bummer.</p>
<h3 id="have-you-considered-going-to-industry-whats-your-next-career-move">Have you considered going to industry? What’s your next career move?</h3>
<p>No. I want to go down the academic pathway.</p>
<h3 id="what-do-you-think-how-a-university-or-an-instituite-decides-to-hire-a-new-faculty-member">What do you think how a university or an instituite decides to hire a new faculty member?</h3>
<p>More than 50% research accomplishment, teaching skills, and your potential to get funding. Interpersonal skills become indispensible in the process of obtaining a new funding.</p>
