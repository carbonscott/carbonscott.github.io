<h1 class="title">A conversation with a Stanford postdoc</h1>

<p>Should I become a postdoc? Here’s what I learned following a conversation with a postdoc working at the Stanford University. He graduated with a doctoral degree in chemistry in May 2018.</p>
<h3 id="when-did-you-start-to-look-for-post-doctoral-positions-how-did-it-go">When did you start to look for post-doctoral positions? How did it go?</h3>
<p>I started looking for postdoc positions in Oct 2017. I did my own research and selected 30-40 top research groups in the field of my interest. Then, I discussed with my PhD supervisor regarding the selections I made. My supervisor gave me invaluable suggestions on their research and their working culture. What’s more, when you reach out to a new research group by yourself, it’s really hard to even get any response. If you supervisor could help you get in touch, you certainly have a higher chance of getting feedback. I eventually decided to go to my current lab.</p>
<h3 id="do-you-keep-learning-new-skillstechniques-or-you-keep-applying-phd-skills-to-your-current-work">Do you keep learning new skills/techniques or you keep applying PhD skills to your current work?</h3>
<p>I keep learning new skills. My PhD background is fundamental electrochemistry. My current research is more interdisciplinary including working with biologists. I think both senarios exist in a research lab. Some postdocs dive deeper in the field that they worked on during their PhD time. But some try out a new branch of research. In fact, a benefit of trying new things is that it enables people work across different disciplines. So you will collaborate with people and it enlarges the impact of your research.</p>
<h3 id="as-a-postdoc-what-are-the-things-you-likedislike">As a postdoc, what are the things you like/dislike?</h3>
<p>Interesting! I think the thing I like and dislike is the same – collaboration in an interdisciplinary environment. On one hand, you are making impact on a larger scale. On the other hand, the duration of a project is substantailly longer than my past field – electrochemistry. The pandemic exacerbated my research progress. I had to change my plan after the lab was reopen in June.<br />
It’s a big bummer.</p>
<h3 id="have-you-considered-going-to-industry-whats-your-next-career-move">Have you considered going to industry? What’s your next career move?</h3>
<p>No. I want to go down the academic pathway.</p>
<h3 id="what-do-you-think-how-a-university-or-an-instituite-decides-to-hire-a-new-faculty-member">What do you think how a university or an instituite decides to hire a new faculty member?</h3>
<p>Research accomplishment, teaching skills, and your potential to get fundings. Your competitors might be as accomplished as you. If you have applied for funding in your earlier career, it’s going to be an advantage. Meanwhile, interpersonal skills become indispensible in the process of obtaining a new funding. So it does not simply depend on your research accomplishment.</p>
